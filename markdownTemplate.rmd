#Intro to markdown syntax

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Markdown language is the human readable part of the documentation. Use it to describe what you did in detail. 

##You can format the text in a lot of fun ways.  
1. Make the text **bold**  
2. Make the text _italics_  
3. Insert Pictures ![](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/blue-125.png)

The formatting can get a little strange, but the cheat sheet is great. Remember that unless your line ends with a space  
the text will wrap

#Let's embed some code!
You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. See the cheat sheet for more options.
